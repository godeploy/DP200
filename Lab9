### Module 9 - Monitoring and Troubleshooting Data Storage and Processing

@@@secondary
**Lab overview**

The students will be able to define a broad monitoring solution that can help them monitor issues that can occur in their data estate. The student will then experience common data storage issues and data processing issue that can occur in cloud data solution. Finally they will implement a disaster recovery approach for a Data Platform technology.

**Lab objectives**
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Explain the monitoring capabilities that are available
1. Troubleshoot common data storage issues
1. Troubleshoot common data processing issues
1. Manage disaster recovery

**Scenario**
  
As the Senior Data Engineer at AdventureWorks you have been tasked with defining the standard operating procedures for monitoring that data estate within the organization. You will start by defining the monitoring tools that will be used to support the approach.

You will then explore some of the common data storage and data processing issues that can occur during the normal operation of your infrastructure.

There are concerns around the recovery of the Products database that is stored in the awcdbstudxx Cosmos DB. The IS department has asked you to provide high level steps that would be taken in the event that the products database has become unavailable through an accidental deletion or removal of the database.

At the end of this lad, you will have:

1. Explain the monitoring capabilities that are available
1. Troubleshoot common data storage issues
1. Troubleshoot common data processing issues
1. Manage disaster recovery
