### Module 8: Securing Azure Data Platforms

@@@secondary
**Lab overview**

The students will be able to describe and document the different approaches to security that can be taken to provide defence in depth. This will involve the student documenting the security that has been set up so far in the course. It will also enable the students to identify any gaps in security that may exists for AdventureWorks.

**Lab objectives**
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. An Introduction to Security
1. Key security components
1. Securing Storage Accounts and Data Lake Storage
1. Securing Data Stores
1. Securing Streaming Data

**Scenario**
  
As a senior data engineer within AdventureWorks, you are responsible for ensuring that your data estate is secured. You are performing a security check of your current infrastructure to ensure that you have diligently placed security where it is required. This check should be a holistic check of all the services and data that you have created so far, and an identification of any gaps that there may be in the configuration of the security. 

You have also been asked to tighten up the security of the SQL Database DeptDatabasesxx and have been asked to setup auditing against the database so that you can monitor access to the database. Furthermore, you have learned that that the Manage permission for your event hub is not restrictive enough, and you want to remove this permission.

At the end of this lad, you will have:

1. An introduction to security
1. Key security components
1. Securing Storage Accounts and Data Lake Storage
1. Securing Data Stores
1. Securing Streaming Data
